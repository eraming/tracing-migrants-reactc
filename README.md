Using data from Missing Migrants Project

Missing Migrants Project counts migrants, asylum-seekers, and refugees who have died at the external borders of states, or in the process of migration towards an international destination, regardless of their legal status. The Project records only those migrants who die during their journey to a country different from their country of residence.

This visualization represents totals by region, which can be further filtered by month of the year.
